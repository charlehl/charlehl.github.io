  I am a recent graduate from a data analytics boot camp from the continuing education division of the University of California, Irvine.  
  In my time at the data analytics boot camp, we covered various topics within the world of data science, including machine learning, 
  big data analytics, data visualizations, web scrapping, social media mining, front-end visualizations, databases (SQL and NoSQL), 
  full-stack development and business intelligence software (Tableau).  In addition, we covered the programming languages of Python, R and JavaScript.

  Currently, I work full-time as a design verification engineer in a chip design team at Broadcom but I am looking to transition into the data science 
  realm as this is where I see the future going, love the subject and enjoy the infinite opportunities that data science provides.  In addition, 
  I freelance as a data scientist for Mixcord.  I am currently assisting them with data analysis and other exploration tasks.  During my transition 
  period and post-graduation from my boot camp, I have continued to grow myself as a data scientist by taking various courses in Udemy, SAS, DataCamp 
  and AWS training.  I believe that with my unique background and passion for data that I can contribute immediately to any company and would love an 
  opportunity to be a data scientist going forward.
